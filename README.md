# Pinia Movies

This is my first exposure to the [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) store library.

## API

This project uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
To ensure the proper functionality of this project, you need to get an API key - https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs.
Once you get your key, you need to create a `.env` file in the project's root, which should contain the `VITE_API_KEY` key with the value of the API key you received.


## Run
```bash
  npm run dev
```
